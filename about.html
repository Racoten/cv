    <h2 class="idColor">Story time</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="textColor">
    I started loving cyber security because ever since I was a kid,
    I used to love computers and video games and just really love technology
    I first started learning C++ because my dad was the one who told me to
    focus in, but after that I switched to python and just fell hard for how
    easy the language was and how fast you could make small scripts to full programs.

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    After getting comfortable with python I began taking hacking courses.
    I liked Zaid Sabih's a lot because he explained them at a very beginner paced
    which was good since hacking is such a big subject. I learned almost everything
    from taking his other courses too. Because I was attending college I wasn't very
    focused on them but I was constantly thinking in my head on how the attacks worked.
    I also began to see how easy it was to create hacking programs in a programming
    language: for me it was Python obviously. And so I switched on over learning
    different Python libraries like: socket, beautifulSoup4, requests, paramiko and others
    to aid me in my exploitation practice. But because I was still in college then I wasn't
    going very fast, I was taking my time.

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    Once I felt comfortable with beginner hacking concepts and techniques, I shifted my focus
    on getting my first certification: the eLearn Security Junior Penetration Tester. I knew
    this was a big step for me because finally I could proof I could become a professional
    penetration tester some day. After getting that certification, I spent just about every
    day I could practicing in platforms like: hackthebox, tryhackme, vulnhub, root-me. Then
    after some time I discovered a Udemy teacher called Jesse Kurrus who had courses on vulnerable
    machines somewhat similar to those of OSCP. I immediately fell in love with the content
    and just everything he was doing. That's when I finally felt like the skills I learned I was
    putting them into good use.

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    Just this summer of 2021 I was taking my toughest exam yet: the eCPPTv2, it was hard... I mean
    there were times I really questioned if I was any good. But I persevered. Fun fact, before the
    exam, I wasn't ready for the buffer overflow part. Up to this point, I could never get that reverse
    callback. It was during the exam, and brutally painful to finally get the exploit working. I knew
    That if I couldn't crack the buffer overflow, I was *NOT* gonna pass the exam. I screamed when I got
    the reverse shell callback.

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    Now I'm just constantly doing HackTheBox and Vulnhub machines. I'm not a noob but I'm definitely not the
    best at hacking. I think everyone I've met who are into hacking are way better than me.
    I learn a lot from them... stuff I didn't even ever considered or just forgot. All in all,
    I like where I am right now and I will keep learning and practicing until my hands hurt...
    almost always but still I don't normally stop.
