        I started loving cyber security because ever since I was a kid,
        I used to love computers and video games and just really love technology
        I first started learning C++ because my dad was the one who told me to
        focus in, but after that I switched to python and just fell hard for how
        easy the language was and how fast you could make small scripts to full programs.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        After getting comfortable with python I began taking hacking courses.
        I liked Zaid Sabih's a lot because he explained them at a very beginner paced
        which was good since hacking is such a big subject. I learned almost everything
        from taking his other courses too. Because I was attending college I wasn't very
        focused on them but I was constantly thinking in my head on how the attacks worked.
        I also began to see how easy it was to create hacking programs in a programming
        language: for me it was Python obviously. And so I switched on over learning
        different Python libraries like: socket, beautifulSoup4, requests, paramiko and others
        to aid me in my exploitation practice. But because I was still in college then I wasn't
        going very fast, I was taking my time.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        Once I felt comfortable with beginner hacking concepts and techniques, I shifted my focus
        on getting my first certification: the eLearn Security Junior Penetration Tester. I knew
        this was a big step for me because finally I could proof I could become a professional
        penetration tester some day. After getting that certification, I spent just about every
        day I could practicing in platforms like: hackthebox, tryhackme, vulnhub, root-me. Then
        after some time I discovered a Udemy teacher called Jesse Kurrus who had courses on vulnerable
        machines somewhat similar to those of OSCP. I immediately fell in love with the content
        and just everything he was doing. That's when I finally felt like the skills I learned I was
        putting them into good use.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        Just this summer of 2021 I was taking my toughest exam yet: the eCPPTv2, it was hard... I mean
        there were times I really questioned if I was any good. But I persevered. Fun fact, before the
        exam, I wasn't ready for the buffer overflow part. Up to this point, I could never get that reverse shell
        callback. It was during the exam, and brutally painful to finally get the exploit working. I knew
        that if I couldn't crack the buffer overflow, I was *NOT* gonna pass the exam. I screamed when I got
        the reverse shell callback.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        Now I'm just constantly doing HackTheBox and Vulnhub machines. I'm not a noob but I'm definitely not the
        best at hacking. I think everyone I've met who are into hacking are way better than me.
        I learn a lot from them... stuff I didn't even ever considered or just forgot. All in all,
        I like where I am right now and I will keep learning and practicing until my hands hurt...
        almost always but still I don't normally stop.

    I'm back again... didn't think I would be though. A lot has happened so there is a lot to catch up.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
    First of all, after that last update, just before the college semester, I got into a new mindset. While doing the eCPPTv2 exam,
    I had this feeling that, with my new skillset, I could start doing some stuff. Specifically in Offensive Tooling. So,
    I started research ways on how to build something that I would've needed for the exam, and that I know I could do it.
    Naturally, in classic pentesting, the hacker needs to be able to control computers remotely... so why not a Reverse Shell!
    So I started working, I made a project in github called "The Backdoor Project", it used TCP communications for the Server
    and Client. Both written in Python too. I'm the type of person that, when something is on my mind... something I have a very
    strong believe I could accomplish, it actually starts bothering me so much and just start doing it lol. This proofs 
    true later on in the update.

    <br>
    <br>
    
    Naturally, I had coded so much Python that when I finished the backdoor project I felt satisfied and ready to close that phase.
    You know what I mean... you Minecraft players. You ever wanted to play Minecraft so bad you actually download it, start working
    hard on that project you have in mind, and then when you're done with it... you just... stop. That was it for me, I have The Backdoor
    Project just lying there in the github repository (it's private btw) me not being able to touch it. Maybe later when something comes in
    my mind (which will be true in another sense) I'll maybe continue working on it.

    <br>
    <br>
    
    College semester came and went. I took a class on Data Structures and Algorithms using C++ which really refined my skills on the language.
    And in December, I got a call offering an interview as an IT Technician. I was like: "huh?..." I quickly gathered my thoughts, like 
    the anxious nerd I started reading tasks that IT Techs do and such. The first interview, which was the non-technical one, wen great. 
    The questions were really about character and thought process. After that, I continued on to the second interview, which was the technical one.
    Again, it went great, it was with the director of IT and he liked me. I got the job, worked there while in college still. That was 
    the semester I finally took a good class (not that Data Structures was bad), it was rough though. Between work and the final project,
    it took a long time but we managed to complete it. That summer was... eventful... just gonna leave it at that. I was studying hard for
    the PEN300 course by Offensive Security - Evasion Techniques and Breaching Defenses. That course REALLY opened my eyes to a lot of stuff.
    From malware development, to evasion tactics like AMSI Patching, Payload Encryption. They layed foundations which helped me reach for
    more material on those topics. When I finished with the course content, I delved straight into the Challenges. I managed to do Challenge 1 and
    2 with relative ease (not that they were easy lol). It was the 3rd Challenge, for folks who did all the challenges, I got stuck in the
    Supply Chain part. Gonna leave it at that lol.

    <br>
    <br>
    
    So that new semester of college, August 2022, I quit my job. I couldn't handle the pressure anymore even more so when my boss wasn't really
    someone that helped you grow a lot so... yeah. But funny enough, the day before my birthday, I was just scrolling around with my friend on call on Discord,
    And my brain ALL of the sudden came up with the idea of a Command and Control Framework. Just out of nowhere. I started watching Daniel Duggan's 
    talk on C2 development using the Moscow Principle and I just started a markdown draft of every single I thing I would want to see in my C2.
    I just went on and on and on like when I was doing the Backdoor Project, my mind was infected with this idea. Like Inception, the idea was
    like a virus, spreading until taking over. I was going talk after talk after research article after white papers after blog posts just taking
    ideas to add to my C2. I have not stopped working on it either coding or just critical thinking. In fact I don't think I ever will, I want to see
    how far this goes.

    I mean the list goes on and on but you get the point. I wanted to make the invisible implant in every sense of the word. After finishing the college
    semester in December, I went on a holiday vacation, but when I came back I bought the then-recently released Red Team Ops 2. I really hammered that course
    because I wanted to understand the material on EDR evasion. After that, I just casually bought the CRTP course in January and in about 3 weeks, I took
    the exam and passed it! :D.
